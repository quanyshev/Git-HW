I been known to miss a red flag
I been known to put my lover on a pedestal
In the end, those things just don't last
And it's time I take my rose-coloured glasses off

I already know your type, tellin' me the things I like (Mm)
Tryna make me yours for life, takin' me for a ride (Mm)
I already know your type, think you playin' your cards right (Mm)
Don't you know I could do this dance all night?

Ooh, what you doin'?
Don't know who you think that you're confusin'
I be like, ooh, it's amusin'
You think I'm gonna fall for an illusion
